# Coffee Machine Project in Python

This Python project, modeled after a coffee machine, demonstrates the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and user interaction through terminal input. 

## Core Concepts Explored:

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
    - **Classes and Objects**: The `CoffeeMachine` class represents a blueprint for creating instances (objects) of coffee machines with specific properties and methods.
    - **Instance Variables**: Variables such as `water`, `milk`, `coffee_beans`, `cups`, and `money` that store data pertaining to each instance of the class.
    - **Methods**: Functions defined within the class, such as `get_state`, `check_resources`, and `buy_coffee`, which perform actions using or affecting the instance variables.

2. **User Interaction**:
    - The `interact_with_machine` function facilitates the interaction between the user and the coffee machine, allowing users to perform various actions like buying coffee, filling ingredients, checking the state of the machine, and more.

3. **Control Flow**:
    - Use of `if-elif-else` statements to guide program behavior based on user input.
    - The loop `while True:` in `interact_with_machine` keeps the program running and interactive until the user decides to exit.

4. **Dictionaries for Data Management**:
    - The `coffees` dictionary in the `buy_coffee` method acts as a menu with keys as coffee choices and values as dictionaries detailing the resources needed for each coffee type.

5. **Input Validation**:
    - Before processing the coffee request, the program checks if there are enough resources using the `check_resources` method. If resources are insufficient, the user is notified.

6. **Modularity**:
    - The code is structured into separate methods, each with a specific responsibility, promoting code reusability and clean organization.
    - The `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct ensures the main interaction is executed only when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module.

## Sample Code Snippets:

- **Class Definition**:

  ```python
  class CoffeeMachine:
      def __init__(self, water, milk, coffee_beans, cups, money):
          ...
  ```

- **Checking Resources**:

  ```python
  def check_resources(self, water, milk, beans, cost):
      if self.water - water < 0:
          return "Sorry, not enough water!"
      ...
  ```

- **User Interaction Loop**:

  ```python
  def interact_with_machine(machine):
      while True:
          action = input("Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit): ")
          ...
  ```

## Conclusion:

This coffee machine simulation is a practical representation of applying OOP principles in Python. By modularizing functionalities, it becomes easy to expand or modify the program. For example, new types of coffee or additional machine functionalities can be added without much change to the existing structure.
